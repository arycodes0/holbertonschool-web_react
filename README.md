## Basic Types in TypeScript
TypeScript provides several basic types that you can use to annotate variables and function return types. These include:
- `boolean`
- `number`
- `string`
- `array`
- `tuple`
- `enum`
- `any`
- `void`
- `null` and `undefined`
- `never`

## Interfaces, Classes, and Functions
### Interfaces
Interfaces define the structure of an object. They are used for type-checking in TypeScript.

### Classes
Classes in TypeScript are similar to those in other object-oriented languages. They can have properties and methods.

### Functions
Functions in TypeScript can have typed parameters and return types. This helps in ensuring that the function is used correctly.

## Working with the DOM and TypeScript
TypeScript can be used to interact with the DOM. You can use types to ensure that you are manipulating the DOM elements correctly.

## Generic Types
Generics allow you to create reusable components. They provide a way to create functions, classes, and interfaces that work with a variety of types.

## Namespaces
Namespaces are used to organize code in TypeScript. They provide a way to group related code together.

## Merging Declarations
TypeScript allows you to merge multiple declarations into a single entity. This is useful for extending existing types.

## Ambient Namespaces and External Libraries
Ambient namespaces are used to describe the shape of libraries that do not have TypeScript type definitions. They allow you to use external libraries in your TypeScript code.

## Basic Nominal Typing
Nominal typing is a type system where compatibility between types is determined by explicit declarations rather than structural compatibility.
